# Fast-Parallel-Algorithms-for-Short-Range-Molecular-Dynamics
S. J. Plimpton, J Comp Phys, 117, 1-19 (1995).  Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter--atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region
